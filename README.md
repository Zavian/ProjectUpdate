# ProjectUpdater
Python project on creating an auto updater AppStore like.
This project has the purpose on trying Python and his power. Probably a Python programmer will find here some huge mistakes, but that's ok because with mistakes you learn things, isn't?

This project will be done with the collaboration of a friend of mine that you can find [Here (Phophore)](https://github.com/phosphore).
